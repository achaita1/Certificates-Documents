diffERENCES B/W xpath & css
1.Xpath allows bidirectional flow which means the traversal can be both ways from parent to child and child to parent as well. Css allows only one directional flow which means the traversal is from parent to child only.
2.Xpath is slower in terms of performance and speed than Css.
3.Xpath allows identification with the help of text() function. Css does not have this feature.
4.There are two types of xpath â€“ absolute and relative. But css has no such types.
